md-pre
======

`md-pre` is a command line utility for quickly previewing Markdown documents in the browser. `md-pre` will convert your Markdown to HTML, write said HTML to a file located in a temp directory, and then open up that file in your default browser. The CSS used for the rendered Markdown is the same CSS that GitHub uses. 

Installation

$ npm install -g md-pre
```

Usage

```
$ md-pre --help
Usage: md-pre [options] file

Options:
  -d, --dir   directory generated HTML file will be placed    [default: "/tmp"]
  -o, --open  command to use to open the generated HTML file  [default: "open"]
  --verbose   md-pre will let you know what it's doing
```
